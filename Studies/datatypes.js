/**
 * DATA TYPES
 * 
 * 0. JavaScript has numerous different data types, a variable can hold any of the data types. Data Types are just types of data that
 * can be used and manipulated in a program.
 * 1. Number is anything that represents a number such as 1, 2, 3 or even negatives -1, -2, -3, as well as decimals
 * 2. String's are a series of characters enclosed in either '', or "".
 * 3. Booleans can only have two values, true, or false.
 * 4. Array's are a complex datatype that can hold other data types enclosed in brackes [], and each item is seperated
 * by commas. Array's are also zero indexed, meaning they start at 0.
 * 5. Objects are another complex data type that is written with curly braces {}, with there properties seperated into
 * key/value pairs seperated by commas.
 * 6. Functions are a block of code designed to perform particular tasks, it is excecuted when it is called with "something"
 * 7. The undefined data type occurs when when a variable is declared without a value.
 * 8. The null value represents the internal absence of any object value, null expresses the lack of identification.
 * 9. NaN is a global property that represents "Not a Number".
 * 10. Infinity is a number that represents positive infinity while -infinity represents negative infinity.
 * 11. Primitive data types are the lowest of all the datatypes and can be tested with the typeof operator, while
 * data types have primitive data types in them which is what makes them complex.
 * 12. When passing BY COPY in JavaScript a copy of the original variable is created, so any changes to the copied
 * variable do not affect the original. While passing BY REFERENCE we pass the reference to the actual parameter,
 * and no copy is created.

/**
 * OPERATORS:
 * 
 * 0: There are several different operators in JavaScript; operators are used to assign values, compare values,
 * perform arithmetic operations, and more.
 * 1: Assignment operators are used to assign values to JavaScript variables.
 * 2: Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic between variable or values.
 * 3: Comparison operators are used in logical statements to determine equality or the difference
 * between variables or values.
 * 4: Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values.
 * 5: Unary operator's only have one operande, which comes either before or after the operator. (!, typeOf, -, +, etc..)
 * 6: The ternery operator is the only JavaScript operator that has 3 operands: a condition, followed by an expression
 * to execute if truthy, then an expression to execute if falsy.

// Assignment Operators //
    // Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables //
    var myVar = 13; // '=' is just one of a multitude of assignment operators //

    x += y; // Same as x = x + y //

    x -= y; // ==> x = x - y //

// Arithmetic Operators //
    // Arithmetic operators perform arithmetic on values (math man math)
    var add = 6 + 1; // ==> 7

    var mult = 6 * 2; // ==> 12

// Comparison Operators //
